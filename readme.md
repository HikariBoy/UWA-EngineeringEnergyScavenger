# UWA Energy Scavenger
<img src="images\UWA-Full-Ver-CMYK3.png" alt="UWA logo"  align="right" width="150"/><br>
 The circuit you have build is an Energy Scavenger, based on a previous project called a [Joule Thief](https://www.instructables.com/Colour-Changing-Night-Joule-Thief/
 )(a pun based on Jewel thief but suggesting the purpuse - to steal the available energy). The project is designed to emphasis concepts around sustainability - the project allows a night light to be powered from a AA battery a 1.5V battery), even when the battery is considered usefull to power other electronics such as cameras and torches.  It will power the night light even when the AA battery has discharged all the way down to 0.6V !! The circuit also include a light dependent resistor (LDR) - a sensor which responds to the amount of light in the room.  When you cover the sensor with your finger, it acts as if it's night time and the white Light Emitting Diodes ([LEDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode)) turn on.  The sensitivity of the circuit to light can be adjusted by opening the 3D printed case and using  a small screw driver to turning the adjustment (potentiometer) as indicated in the 2D rendering of the circuit. <img src="images\PCB_3DRenderdTop.png" alt="UWA logo"  align="right" width="150"/><br>
 The circuit for the Energy Scavenger is shown on the left.<img src="images\circuit.png" alt="UWA logo"  align="left" width="150"/>.  It consists a 3 transistors, 2 LEDS, a light dependent resistor, a variable resistor (potentiometer) and 3 resistors.  During assembly the parts are placed on the printed circuit board (PCB) and are held in place by the internal features of the 3D printed case.  So the case not only provides branding (UWA - School or Engineering), and ashthics, but provided an important platform for the parts, making the overall circuit easier to assemble.  Typically when parts are placed on a PCB and then the PCB is turned over to solder the parts in place, the parts can become loose and soem may fall our of position.  So the fnctionality of the 3D printed part is really important in achieving a high level of success with students as they learn to solder, most for the first time.

The skills and engineering used to create this electrical/mechanical system leverage many of the practical skills developed by students while at UWA.  Students achieve this level of knowledge not simply through attending classes (whcih include a significant practical component) but also through clubs and groups.  Such groups includes:<br>
* [UWA Robotics](https://uwarobotics.com.au/)
* [UWAMakers](https://www.facebook.com/uwamakers/posts/here-is-a-quick-guide-to-gaining-access-to-the-makers-lab-whether-you-wish-to-us/2339898429649541/)
* [UWA Motorsports Club](https://www.uwa.edu.au/facilities/motorsport)
* [UWA Aerospace](https://www.facebook.com/UWAAerospace/)<br>

These clubs form an integral part of the UWA experience for stduents as it allows them to independently develop their passion and interest in engineering, learnign from others (stduents and academics) whiel putting the knowledge they gain into practice.  These clubs are not only informed by our teaching, but also support it as well, with groups like the UWAMakers running laboratories for stduents using 3D printers and Laser cutters.
